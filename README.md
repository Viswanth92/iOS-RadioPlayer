This is a demo iOS app that makes use of the Feed Media SDK
to power a Pandora-style Internet-radio app. The app 
shows how you can use station metadata to hide stations
and assign images and descriptive text to them.

Check out our [Android version](https://github.com/feedfm/Android-RadioPlayer) as well!
